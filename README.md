Introduction
============

The dcm-agent is an open source python project for use with the Dell Cloud
Manager (DCM).  When installed inside of a virtual machine that is launched
using DCM it gives DCM system level control over the VM instance and thus
allows for the automated creation, monitoring, and control of sophisticated
cloud applications.  Some of the features that it provides are:

- Server health monitoring
- Automated software installation/configuration
- Adding/removing users
- Disk volume management

The internal workings of the dcm-agent and its interactions with DCM are
outside of the scope of this document.  However we will present some general
information on how the agent works in order to assist in trouble shooting.
